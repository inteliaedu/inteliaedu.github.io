# Roberto Bonilla | Founder @ Intelia

Hi!,

I am delighted to introduce myself as **Roberto Bonilla**, a seasoned AI developer with an extensive background of over 5 years. Throughout my career, I have been actively involved in designing and constructing cutting-edge AI & data models in top-notch companies.

With an unwavering passion for data and a wealth of experience as a **senior data scientist at Coca Cola and Oracle**, I have encountered numerous challenging projects that have honed my skills. Moreover, during my pursuit of a Masters' degree in Madrid, I recognized a significant gap in the realm of Spanish AI content, a lack of comprehensive and detailed resources for the community. This realization served as the inspiration behind the inception of **Intelia**.

>In essence, my vision for the forthcoming five years revolves around fostering the **largest community of Spanish-speaking AI enthusiasts**. Through the establishment of Intelia, we aim to revolutionize the landscape by providing unparalleled resources, expertise, and support to empower individuals interested in AI and related fields.
